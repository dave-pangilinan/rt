                            <p>Can you keep a secret?</p>
                            <p>Romblon Islands is a cultural and natural wonderland, undiscovered and unspoiled by mass tourism. Located at the heart of the Philippines, the islands have traditionally been considered a hard to reach destination, which has resulted in the preservation of the culture and environment like nowhere else in the Philippines. A host of new transport partners are opening up peaceful and pristine collection of twenty main islands to tourism, and the warm and inviting communities of the Province are welcoming visitors with united vision of sharing their rich eco-cultural sites whilst retaining the peace and tranquility that makes their home so special.</p>
                            <p>The three largest islands - <strong>Tablas</strong>, <strong>Romblon</strong> and <strong>Sibuyan</strong> - each have their own distinct attractions to explore.</p>
                            <p><strong>Tablas</strong> island abounds with adventures for nature lovers from caves, waterfalls, secluded coves, and outstanding dive sites including the Philippines most famous blue hole. The island is also home to the commercial center of the province Odiongan, a progressive town with excellent services and facilities.</p>
                            <p>The island of <strong>Romblon</strong> is a romantic and sophisticated destination, boasting the beautiful well-preserved provincial capital of Romblon. The island is rich in cultural sites including the heritage listed 1600s era cathedral and fort, and other architecturally significant homes and buildings, interspersed with excellent restaurants, cafes and shops. Walking around Romblon town is often described as having the same ambiance of a charming Italian village. The island is also geographically stunning, surrounded by white sandy beaches, protected marine parks and crystal clear waters that are a mecca for snorkelers and divers.</p>
                            <p><strong>Sibuyan</strong> island is not only the province's best kept secret, but the hidden gem of the Philippines. Dubbed "the Galapagos of Asia&rdquo; by local and international scientists, the island is home to a world of unique species of flora and fauna. Its breathtaking peak, Mt Guiting-Guiting, is characterized by steep slopes which together with its geographic isolation has created an environment for rare and unique species to prosper. Sibuyan lsland is also blessed with some of the Philippines most picturesque waterfalls, rivers and streams of crystal clear waters including the Philippines cleanest river, the mighty Cantingas.</p>
                            <p>The three large islands are surrounded by smaller island destinations which offer a host of eco cultural experiences. To the south of the province is Boracay's lesser known twin <strong>Carabao Island (San Jose)</strong> which offers resorts and stretches of spectacular white sandy beaches without the noise and hype of its highly developed neighbor. To the north of the province there are the cultural gems of <strong>Banton</strong>. <strong>Concepcion (Sibale)</strong> and <strong>Corcuera (Simara)</strong> islands where artifacts of national significance are still uncovered today. Close to Sibuyan Island is the scenic Cresta de Gallo, a small uninhabited island of lush terrain and glorious beaches, perfect for picnics, snorkeling and diving.</p>
                            <p>If you love nature, culture, beauty and adventure, we invite you to discover Romblon.</p>

                                                <p>Romblon is an archipelagic province of the Philippines located in the Mimaropa region. Its main islands include Tablas, the largest, which covers nine municipalities, Sibuyan with its three towns, as well as the smaller island municipalities of Corcuera, Banton, Concepcion, San Jose, and Romblon, the provincial capital. The province lies south of Marinduque and Quezon, east of Oriental Mindoro, north of Aklan and Capiz, and west of Masbate. According to the 2015 census, it has a total population of 292,781.</p>
                                                <p>Romblon has been inhabited by aboriginal Filipinos prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1569. Archaeological artifacts recovered by the National Museum in 1936 indicate that the aborigines of Romblon already have a rich and advanced culture. Under Spanish colonial rule, Romblon was initially administered under the newly established province of Arevalo, until 1716, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created province of Capiz. With arrival of the Americans in 1901, Romblon was declared a province and placed under civilian rule. It lost its provincial status for a short while between 1907 and 1945, but regained it in 1946, just after World War II.</p>
                                                <p>The inhabitants of Romblon are divided into three ethnolinguistic groups: Romblomanon, Onhan and Asi. These groups occupy specific islands in the province and have their own language and customs. Romblomanon is mainly spoken in the town of Romblon, in all of three towns of Sibuyan Island, and the town of San Agustin in Tablas Island. Onhan is mainly spoken in the municipalities in the southern part of Tablas Island (Alcantara, Looc, Ferrol, Santa Fe, San Andres, and Santa Maria) as well as in the island municipality of San Jose. The northwestern part of Tablas Island (in Odiongan and Calatrava, as well as the islands municipalities of Corcuera, Banton, and Concepcion, speak the Asi language.</p>
                                                <p>Currently, the province relies on agriculture, particularly rice and copra farming as well as fishing, for its livelihood. It also has a lucrative marble industry due to an abundance of Italian-quality marble, hence, its moniker as the "Marble Capital of the Philippines." In recent years, the province has also become an ecotourism destination, with several white sand beaches, diving spots, mountains and rainforests that tourists visit annually.</p>

                                                <p>According to legend, the name "Romblon" was derived from the Romblomanon word Nagalumyom, which pertains to a chicken in the act of sitting on its eggs on a nest. This eventually evolved to Lomlom, and later on to Donblon, the name reported by Spanish chronicler Miguel de Loarca in his book Relacion de las Islas Filipinas in 1582, before finally evolving to Romblon.</p>
                                                <p>Meanwhile, local historians Roland Madeja and Evelyn Reyes relate the origin of the name "Romblon" to the shape of Romblon Island. Madeja claims that the name was derived from the Spanish word ronblon, another term for tornillo, meaning "screw." According to him, the Spanish claimed to have observed the screw-like shape of Romblon Island. Meanwhile, Reyes claims Romblon originated from "doubloon", which refers to the Spanish coin used by Moro pirates in paying dowries for their brides-to-be. The Spanish might have named the island after the shape of the coin.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Early history</strong></p>
                                                <p>Romblon's aboriginal inhabitants were the Negritos from Panay and Mangyans from Mindoro, who settled in the islands during the precolonial period. Ancient wooden coffins discovered in the Guyangan Cave System of Banton Island in 1936 signify a rich ancient civilization and culture in the province before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1569. These artifacts are currently on display at the National Museum in Manila. Remnants of Negrito and Mangyan aborigines now live in the mountains of Tablas and Sibuyan after they were displaced by the influx of Hiligaynon, Aklanon, Bicolano and Tagalog migrants as early as 1870.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Spanish period</strong></p>
                                                <p>According to historians Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, the Spanish arrived in Romblon in 1569 led by conquistador Martin de Goiti who was dispatched by Miguel L&oacute;pez de Legazpi to explore the western and northern portion of the Visayas region including Romblon and Mindoro. The islands were later organized into three encomiendas and were administered from Arevalo. De Loarca visited Romblon in 1582 and conducted the first census of the islands.</p>
                                                <p>In 1635, Recollect missionaries arrived in Romblon to establish Catholic missions and settlements. They helped the Spanish authorities establish peace and order in the islands. In 1878, they established seven missionary centers at Romblon, Badajoz (San Agustin), Cajidiocan, Banton, Looc, Odiongan and Magallanes (Magdiwang). They also built massive forts, churches and watchtowers in the province, such as Fort San Jose in Banton and Fort San Andres in Romblon, following a Dutch attack in 1646 which destroyed the capital town and to repulse recurring Moro raids.</p>
                                                <p>Romblon was separated from the jurisdiction of Arevalo and annexed to Capiz, when the province was created in 1716. More than a century later in 1850, the inhabitants of the province began using Spanish family names after governor-general Narciso Claver&iacute;a decreed on 21 November 1849 the use of surnames from the Cat&aacute;logo alfab&eacute;tico de apellidos. Asi-speaking natives were assigned the letter F, Romblomanon speakers were assigned the letter M, speakers of the Sibuyanon style of Romblomanon were assigned the letter R, while Onhan-speaking natives were assigned the letter G.</p>
                                                <p>In 1853, the islands were organized into a politico-military commandancia ("sub-province" in English) administered from Capiz and continued to be so until the end of the Spanish rule in 1898. As a sub-province, Romblon was under an army officer with the rank of captain. The town of Romblon was its capital and the other municipalities were Azagra, Badajos (now San Agustin), Banton, Cajidiocan, Corcuera, Looc, Magallanes (now Magdiwang), Odiongan, Despujols (now San Andres) and Santa Fe.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Revolutionary period</strong></p>
                                                <p>In 1898, amid the Philippine Revolution, Katipunan leader Emilio Aguinaldo sent his generals to several provinces in the Visayas to expand the recognition of his revolutionary government in the central and southern Philippines. The Katipunan general Mariano Riego de Dios and his forces liberated Romblon, while generals Ananias Diocno and Leandro Fullon proceeded to Panay. On 25 July the same year, Riego de Dios took the Romblon capital and captured Spanish officials. Four days later, the Spanish politico-military governor Don Carlos Mendoza formally signed the surrender of Romblon&rsquo;s district government, ending more than three hundred years of Spanish rule in the archipelagic province.</p>
                                                <p>Later, Don Wenceslao Molo, a local from Romblon town, was appointed governor and became responsible for the collection of a total amount of ₱22,765.21, Romblon&rsquo;s share to the war expenditures of the Revolutionary Government from 31 May 1898 to 28 February 1899. A local election was also held in Romblon town for its ministers of justice and barrio officials. However, Molo&rsquo;s term was a brief transition to another era as the Americans arrived in the province a few months later.</p>
                                                <p><strong>American period</strong></p>
                                                <p>Upon the restoration of peace and order in the province following the Philippine-American War, the Americans established civilian government in the islands on 16 March 1901. Romblon was created as a regular province in the same year but due to insufficient income, it became a sub-province of Capiz again in 1907 until 7 December 1917 when Act No. 2724 reestablished the province. Under Commonwealth Act No. 581, enacted without executive approval on 8 June 1940, the province was reorganized with four towns or municipalities, namely: Tablas (composed of Odiongan, Looc, and Badajoz), Romblon (including the islands of Logbon, Cobrador and Alad), Maghali (comprising Banton, Corcuera, and Concepcion), and Sibuyan (composed of the towns of Cajidiocan, Magdiwang and San Fernando).</p>
                                                <p><strong>Japanese period</strong></p>
                                                <p>During World War II, the Japanese Imperial Forces established a garrison in Romblon on 21 March 1942 which they maintained until the end of the war. The islands became one of the centers of resistance movement against the Japanese. The movement was led by the Free Panay Guerilla Forces composed of members from the 6th Military District under the direction of Col. Macario Peralta, Jr. One of the major naval engagements during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Battle of Sibuyan Sea, happened off the waters of Romblon on 23&ndash;24 October 1944 between Japanese Admiral Kurita&rsquo;s fleet from Singapore and Admiral Halsey's carrier planes from the US Third Fleet then stationed east of the Philippines. Units from Company C of the 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division landed on Sawang, Romblon on the night 11 March 1945. By 18 March, the province was liberated from Japanese forces.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Topography</strong></p>
                                                <p>The province has a total land area of approximately 1,533.45 square kilometres (592 sq mi) representing about 5.3 percent of the total land area of Region IV-B (MIMAROPA). It is generally mountainous with about 40 percent of its land area having an inclination of more than 50 percent. Only four percent of the total area has an inclination of three to eight percent, while a sparse 10 percent has an inclination of three to zero percent. Narrow strips of coastal lowlands, low hills and plains typify the topography of some of the islands.</p>
                                                <p>Romblon Island is hilly with a maximum elevation of about 400 metres (1,300 ft) above sea level. Tablas Island shows varied relief characteristics. The western coastal areas are level to undulating while the eastern coastal areas are rough to rugged. The southern section covering Santa Fe and the mid-western portion maybe described as having rolling to rough terrain. Extremely rugged areas can be found in the central section of the island. The highest elevation is almost 500 metres (1,600 ft) above sea level. Sibuyan Island is a thickly forested mountain mass. The western portion of the island maybe characterized as extensively rugged, having ascents of 60 percent or more while the eastern section is relatively undulating to rolling. The highest elevation, the peak of Mt. Guiting-Guiting, reaches about 2,058 meters (6,750 feet) above sea level.</p>
                                                <p>The major areas that are highly productive and buildable are basically in Tablas and Sibuyan. These include Odiongan, San Andres, Looc and Santa Fe in Tablas Island. All three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, on the other hand, have substantial level to gently sloping lands. Overall, good developable lands represent about 13 percent of the province&rsquo;s total area.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Flora and fauna</strong></p>
                                                <p>Romblon, particularly Sibuyan Island, is among the few places in the Philippines with a well-preserved natural environment. Uninterrupted rainforest covers 75 percent of the island. It is also home to the country's cleanest inland body of water, the Cantigas River, as well as 34 waterfalls. Sibuyan is commonly known the country as the "Galapagos of Asia" because of its many endemic plant and animal species, some of which have just been discovered recently. Among these endemic species are nine mammals, seven lizards, two amphibians, three birds and 112 vascular plants, such as the Nepenthes argentii, Nepenthes sibuyanensis, Nepenthes armin, Sibuyan striped shrew rat, Sibuyan shrew, Philippine tube-nosed fruit bat, indigo-banded kingfisher, and the Romblon hawk-owl. In Tablas Island, at least two endemic bird species can be found: the Tablas drongo and Tablas fantail.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Administrative divisions</strong></p>
                                                <p>Romblon comprises 17 municipalities. Of these, nine are located in Tablas Island (San Agustin, Calatrava, San Andres, Odiongan, Ferrol, Santa Fe, Looc, Alcantara and Santa Maria), three in Sibuyan Island (Magdiwang, Cajidiocan and San Fernando) and five (Romblon, San Jose, Banton, Concepcion and Corcuera) are island municipalities.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Climate</strong></p>
                                                <p>Romblon falls under Type III of the Corona climatic classification system which was devised in 1920. It is characterized by no pronounced wet and dry seasons. Generally, the wet season is from June to November and sometimes extends up to December when the southwest monsoon is predominant. The dry season is from January to May but is sometimes interrupted by erratic rainfall. The annual mean temperature is 27 &deg;C (81 &deg;F), with February as the coldest month with temperatures dropping to 20 &deg;C (68 &deg;F), and May as the warmest month with temperatures reaching up to 35 &deg;C (95 &deg;F). Habagat monsoon winds pass through the province from June to October while northeasterly winds or Amihan blows through the islands from December to February.</p>

                                                <p>The population of Romblon in the 2015 census was 292,781 people, with a density of 190 inhabitants per square kilometre or 490 inhabitants per square mile. It ranks fourth among the five provinces of the MIMAROPA Region in terms of population and represents 9.9 percent of the region&rsquo;s population.</p>
                                                <p>San Jose and Romblon are the two most-densely populated municipalities in the province at 490/km2 and 450/km2, respectively. Cajidiocan is the least densely populated municipality at 110/km2.</p>
                                                <p>Males outnumber females in the province with a sex ratio of 102:100 according to the 2010 census. Of the province&rsquo;s 283,482 household population, males accounted for 144,091 or 50.8 percent while females made up 139,391 or 49.2 percent. The voting-age population (18 years old and over) accounted for 56.6 percent of the household population of the province in 2010, up from 52.7 percent in 2000. There were more females (50.2 percent) than males (49.8 percent) among the voting age population.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Language</strong></p>
                                                <p>The languages of Romblon, as well as all languages native to the Philippines, belong to the Austronesian language family, the second largest language family in the world with 1,257 known languages, second only to the Niger-Congo family's 1,538 languages. All of the languages of the Philippines, except Samalan, are classified as Philippine languages under the Western Malayo-Polynesian branch of Austronesian. The Philippine language group has three main branches: Northern, Southern and Central, the latter of which is composed of the Visayan, Bikol and Tagalog languages.</p>
                                                <p>Unlike other islands or provinces in the Philippines where all local languages are classifiable under the same subgroup of languages, each of the three languages of Romblon &mdash; Romblomanon, Onhan and Asi &mdash; actually belongs to a different subgroup of the Visayan language group. Romblomanon belongs to the Central Visayan subgroup, which spans from Waray-Waray in Samar and Leyte, through Masbatenyo and Bisakol, and as far west as Hiligaynon and Capiznon on Panay. It is spoken in Romblon and Sibuyan Islands, as well as in San Agustin town in Tablas Island.</p>
                                                <p>Onhan, on the other hand, belongs to the Western Visayan subgroup, which includes Kinaray-a and Aklanon as well as several minor languages spoken on Mindoro, Palawan, and some small islands in between. Its speakers are mainly from the southern portion of Tablas Island, in the municipalities of San Andres, Santa Maria, Alcantara, Ferrol, Looc, and Santa Fe, as well as in the municipality of San Jose in Carabao Island. Finally, Asi is not classified under any specific subgroup of Visayan, and instead makes up its own immediate branch of Visayan. David Paul Zorc, a linguist from the Australian National University whose expertise is on Philippine languages, notes that Asi speakers may have been the first Visayan speakers in the region. He also suggests that Asi may have a Cebuano substratum and that many of its words may have been influenced by the later influx of other languages such as Romblomanon. It is spoken in the island municipalities of Banton, Corcuera and Concepcion, as well as in Odiongan and Calatrava in Tablas. Hiligaynon is spoken in municipalities near Capiz and Aklan.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Religion</strong></p>
                                                <p>The people of the province are predominantly Roman Catholic. In 2012, the UP School of Economics reported that in recent years, at least 75 percent were Catholics, around five to nine percent were Muslims, and around three to five percent belonged to Iglesia ni Cristo. Other non catholic Christian groups such as Mainline Protestantism and Evangelicals form a significant minority of up to 12% of the population.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Agriculture</strong></p>
                                                <p>Agriculture is the main industry in Romblon. Coconut is the most cultivated crop with a total planted area of 58,270.44 hectares (224.9834 sq mi). San Agustin has the most extensive area with coconut plants followed by Romblon and Cajidiocan. Rice is the next crop, cultivated particularly in Odiongan, Looc, Cajidiocan and Santa Fe. Other crops grown include root crops, vegetables and fruits. Odiongan, Banton and Magdiwang have the greatest areas planted with root crops and correspondingly, have the highest volume of production. Vegetable production is mostly for home consumption and grown in small scale.</p>
                                                <p>Livestock development and poultry production is a viable small scale enterprise for farmers in the province. The provincial government maintains breeding facilities in strategic locations province-wide to encourage farmers to engage in livestock and poultry production to augment their income. Livestock and poultry management training and seminars is provided to interested clients.</p>
                                                <p>Due to the geographical condition of the province, crops and livestock production is generally deficient as compared to the food requirements of Romblon population. To meet the rice requirements, Romblon relies on imports from the neighboring provinces while vegetables, poultry meat, vegetables and fruits are supplied mostly by Luzon.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Marine resources</strong></p>
                                                <p>Fishing industry is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with demersal fish due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.</p>
                                                <p>Because the province has a great potential for aqua-marine development, the province implemented a coastal and resource management program. Each municipality established a fish sanctuary and passed laws on fishery. The use of air compressors in the municipal waters was regulated and banned altogether in some municipalities.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Mineral resources</strong></p>
                                                <p>Marble is the most significant mineral deposit of Romblon and is the most renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.</p>
                                                <p>Marble quarrying and processing are major activities in Romblon. Among the most common marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips). Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include nickel ore and gold mostly to be found in Sibuyan Island. Gold panning and small-scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.</p>

                                                <p>Being an archipelago, Romblon has several beaches and dive sites. Among its best white sand beaches are Bonbon, Cobrador and Tiamban Beach in Romblon, Macat-ang, Tabunan and Tambak Beach in Banton, Lunas and Bignay Beach in San Jose, and Cresta de Gallo in San Fernando. The sea surrounding Cresta de Gallo is a famous diving site teeming with marine life. Romblon is also home to the only known blue hole in the Philippines in the town of San Agustin. The entrance to the blue hole is a 6-metre (20 ft) wide volcanic chimney, which drops for 20 metres (66 ft) before opening up into the massive chamber below with a total depth of 32 to 40 metres (105&ndash;131 ft).</p>
                                                <p>Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province's tallest mountain, is considered as one of the most difficult climbs in the Philippines, and is thus a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and jagged summit. Another a suitable place for hiking and trekking is Mount Payaopao is Tablas. Meanwhile, Banton's Guyangan Cave System, an Important Cultural Treasure, is where the Banton Cloth &mdash; the earliest known warp ikat textile in Southeast Asia &mdash; was found in 1936.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Heritage sites</strong></p>
                                                <p>Aside from the precolonial Guyangan Cave System in Banton, the province also has several heritage sites built during the Spanish colonial period. In Romblon town, the forts of San Andres and Santiago served as fortifications against Muslim pirates in the 17th century, while the St. Joseph Cathedral and Belfry houses a centuries-old image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Ceb&uacute; or the Holy Child. Both heritage sites were declared National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum. The town also has two Spanish-era bridges that were declared Important Cultural Treasures. A similar fort in Banton, the centuries-old Fort San Jose and Banton Church, were built in the 1600s and was also used as defenses against Muslim pirates.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Executive</strong></p>
                                                <p>Just like any other province in the Philippines, Romblon&rsquo;s chief executive and head is the provincial governor. Elected to a term of three years and limited to three consecutive terms, he or she appoints the directors of each provincial department, which include the office of administration, engineering office, information office, legal office, and treasury office. As of April 2016, the incumbent governor of Romblon is Eduardo C. Firmalo, from the Liberal Party. He first assumed office on 30 June 2010, following his victory in the May 2010 gubernatorial elections. He was reelected in 2013 for a second term which will expire in 2016.</p>
                                                <p>The provincial vice governor performs duties as acting governor in the absence of the provincial governor. He or she also automatically succeeds as governor upon the death of the provincial governor. The provincial vice governor also convenes the Provincial Board or Sangguniang Panlalawigan, the provincial legislative body. The incumbent provincial vice governor of Romblon is Jose Riano from the Liberal Party. He first assumed office on 30 June 2013 after defeating former vice governor Manuel Madrid.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Legislative</strong></p>
                                                <p>The province, which is a lone congressional district, is represented in the Philippine House of Representatives by longtime congressman Eleandro Jesus "Budoy" Madrona from the Nacionalista Party. He first assumed office from 1992 to 2001, serving three terms. Following two terms wherein Perpetuo Ylagan and Eduardo Firmalo respectively represented the district in Congress, Madrona ran and won again in 2007. His third and last term will expire in 2016.</p>
                                                <p>Within the province, the Provincial Board or Sangguniang Panlalawigan crafts all provincial ordinances, performs appropriation of provincial funds, issues franchises and permits, impose fees on provincial services, and exercise other duties and powers as stipulated by the Local Government Code of 1991. Romblon, being a third-class province in terms of income, is entitled to a Provincial Board composed of eight members, four each from the province&rsquo;s two board districts. As of 2013, the incumbent board members from the province&rsquo;s two districts are: (First District) Samuel Romero, Anthony Rugas, Abner Perez, Nelson Lim ; (Second District) Felix Ylagan, Juliet Fiel, Venizar Maravilla, and Andres Fondevilla.</p>
