                                                <p>The island lies about 50 kilometres (31 mi) east from the southern part of Mindoro Island. The northern tip of Tablas is about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from Romblon Island. Mount Payaopao (also known as Tablas Summit on old maps) at the northeastern extremity of the island, is the highest peak on the island at 2,182 feet (665 m) high and the second highest in the province (after Mount Guiting-Guiting).</p>
                                                <p>A wooded central range of hills traverses the length of Tablas. The west coast is formed by the western slope of the central mountain ridge, which is narrow and well defined. The summits in the middle of the island are 1,600 to 2,000 feet high. In the center of the island is Bitaogan Peak, 2,164 feet (660 m) high, which appears as a rounded knob from east and west and sharp from north and south. Mount Lunas, at the back of Looc Bay, is a black ridge 1,556 feet (474 m) high, long and rounded from east and west and sharp from north and south; with it the range breaks off to the low pass from Looc Bay to the town of Alcantara on the east coast. The southern part of Tablas is a group of many sharp conical hills, all bare and grassy except Malbug Hill, 904 feet (276 m) high, and Calaton Point, 835 feet (255 m) high, on the east coast, which are dark and wooded. The shore line is largely mangrove, with many beaches of coral sand and some limestone cliffs. The shore reef is continuous except off Guinauayan Point.</p>
                                                <p>There is no good natural harbor except Looc Bay, a large indentation on the west side, but sheltered anchorage may be found on either side of the island, according to the season of the year.</p>

In 1885, it was annexed back as a barrio of Looc, and would remain so until after World War II.</p>

                                                                    <p>Calatrava, once a barrio in the town of San Agustin (then called Badajoz) in Tablas Island. During pre-Spanish period, the place was called "Andagao", named after a medicinal plant growing in abundance everywhere in the locality especially in places along the shore.</p>
                                                                    <p>Around 1810, the first settlers in Andagao migrated from Banton and Romblon islands, as well as in central parts of Tablas Island, in search of lands more suitable for agriculture. The Simaranhons, Sibalenhons and Bantoanons were the first settlers of the municipality and joined later by migrants from Odiongan of which, like them, spoke Asi. Today, this group of people made up the great portion of its residents, while the northern barangays of Linao, Pangulo and Talisay have significant Romblomanon residents. Onhan settlers originally from central Tablas decided to settle in the southern barangay of Balogo.</p>
                                                                    <p>Around 1838, Andagao was organized into a fundacion (settlement) attached to visita (village) of Odiongan under the pueblo of Banton by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following year, a Spanish friar named Padre Jose Aznar from the parish of Banton visited the place and planned the construction of its first Roman Catholic church made of wood and limestone. Eleuterio Asuncion, the barrio's cabeza de barangay spearheaded its construction. After the church was completed, Andagao immediately progressed and developed. In 1850, people started using family names beginning with letter "F" as decreed by Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria issued on 21 November 1848.</p>
                                                                    <p>In 1853, after the creation of the District of Romblon, 17 new towns were created which included Andagao. This was Calatrava’s first proclamation as a municipality. However, when the District of Romblon was elevated into a full-pledge province a total of 15 towns were abolished, including Andagao. On 11 January 1868, Romblon became a fully pledged province and Andagao reverted to its former status as a visita and it was annexed to the town of Guintiguian (renamed Badajoz on August 28, 1868, now San Agustin).</p>
                                                                    <p>On 14 June 1881, Andagao was renamed Calatrava during the term of the controversial military governor of Romblon, Don Jose Fernandez de Terran (1880–1883), after the Military Order of Calatrava, which was founded by the Cistercian monk St. Raymond of Fitero and tasked to defend the castle of Calatrava and other crucial towns and cities in the Andalucian region from invasions and attacks from the Moors.</p>
                                                                    <strong>Modern history</strong>
                                                                    <p>Calatrava remained part of Badajoz municipality throughout the American colonial period until 4 June 1940, when Commonwealth Act No. 581 (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin) was passed and created the special municipality of Tablas, with its seat at Odiongan. The town of Badajoz became part of the new municipality and was represented with one special municipal councilor at the municipal council in Odiongan. Calatrava, being a barrio of Badajoz then, was not represented. On 4 June 1943, during the Second World War, the special municipality of Calatrava was created upon the sponsorship of the guerrilla movement regime under the Revolutionary Republic of the Philippines. Its first and only mayor then was Benito Famini, Sr. who served up to the liberation period. This was Calatrava's second proclamation as a municipality.</p>
                                                                    <p>On 1 October 1946 Commonwealth Act No. 581 was repealed through the passage of Republic Act No. 38 sponsored by Congressman Modesto Formilleza. Badajoz regained back its independent municipal status and Calatrava was annexed back to Badajoz municipality as a barrio. The same year, a three-man delegation composed of Pablo Fetalino, Lauriano Falcutila, Sr. and Jose Capa from Calatrava went to Manila to lobby for a bill in Congress that will establish Calatrava as an independent municipality but it didn't push through.</p>
                                                                    <p>On 15 June 1968, through the sponsorship Congressman Jose Moreno, Republic Act No. 5317 was drafted and approved which finally established Calatrava as an independent municipality. Thus Calatrava became Romblon's 15th independent constituency under the category of municipal-district. This was Calatrava's third proclamation as a municipality.</p>

                                                                    <p>Calatrava, once a barrio in the town of San Agustin (then called Badajoz) in Tablas Island. During pre-Spanish period, the place was called "Andagao", named after a medicinal plant growing in abundance everywhere in the locality especially in places along the shore.</p>
                                                                    <p>Around 1810, the first settlers in Andagao migrated from Banton and Romblon islands, as well as in central parts of Tablas Island, in search of lands more suitable for agriculture. The Simaranhons, Sibalenhons and Bantoanons were the first settlers of the municipality and joined later by migrants from Odiongan of which, like them, spoke Asi. Today, this group of people made up the great portion of its residents, while the northern barangays of Linao, Pangulo and Talisay have significant Romblomanon residents. Onhan settlers originally from central Tablas decided to settle in the southern barangay of Balogo.</p>
                                                                    <p>Around 1838, Andagao was organized into a fundacion (settlement) attached to visita (village) of Odiongan under the pueblo of Banton by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following year, a Spanish friar named Padre Jose Aznar from the parish of Banton visited the place and planned the construction of its first Roman Catholic church made of wood and limestone. Eleuterio Asuncion, the barrio's cabeza de barangay spearheaded its construction. After the church was completed, Andagao immediately progressed and developed. In 1850, people started using family names beginning with letter "F" as decreed by Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria issued on 21 November 1848.</p>
                                                                    <p>In 1853, after the creation of the District of Romblon, 17 new towns were created which included Andagao. This was Calatrava’s first proclamation as a municipality. However, when the District of Romblon was elevated into a full-pledge province a total of 15 towns were abolished, including Andagao. On 11 January 1868, Romblon became a fully pledged province and Andagao reverted to its former status as a visita and it was annexed to the town of Guintiguian (renamed Badajoz on August 28, 1868, now San Agustin).</p>
                                                                    <p>On 14 June 1881, Andagao was renamed Calatrava during the term of the controversial military governor of Romblon, Don Jose Fernandez de Terran (1880–1883), after the Military Order of Calatrava, which was founded by the Cistercian monk St. Raymond of Fitero and tasked to defend the castle of Calatrava and other crucial towns and cities in the Andalucian region from invasions and attacks from the Moors.</p>
                                                                    <strong>Modern history</strong>

The town of Badajoz became part of the new municipality and was represented with one special municipal councilor at the municipal council in Odiongan. Calatrava, being a barrio of Badajoz then, was not represented. On 4 June 1943, during the Second World War, the special municipality of Calatrava was created upon the sponsorship of the guerrilla movement regime under the Revolutionary Republic of the Philippines. Its first and only mayor then was Benito Famini, Sr. who served up to the liberation period. This was Calatrava's second proclamation as a municipality.</p>

                                                                    <p>Looc is from the Filipino/Onhan word look, meaning "bay", referring to the body of water the town encloses. The first settlers of Looc where Onhan-speaking tribes from Panay Island which came around 1730. The settlement was originally a barrio of the pueblo (town) of Cabolutan (located in present-day San Agustin) until 1790, when the town's population was wiped-out by a smallpox epidemic and the town was abolished. The abolition transferred Looc under the administration of pueblo de Banton in Banton Island.</p>
                                                                    <p>In the early 1800s, the settlement continued to progress and increase its population. Thus, in 1844, Spanish colonial authorities converted Looc into a full-pledged pueblo. Back then, Looc was still part of Capiz province, until 19 March 1853, when Romblon was officially declared a district separate from Capiz, and finally a full-pledged province in 1868. Looc was one of the first four municipalities of the newly created province of Romblon, the other three being Romblon (capitol), Banton, and Sibuyan (Cajidiocan). It then comprised the territories of what is now the municipalities of Alcantara and Santa Fe, and Carabao Island. Looc would lose these territories during the American colonial period beginning in 1901.</p>
                                                                    <strong>Modern History</strong>
                                                                    <p>On 8 June 1940, the municipality was abolished by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581, also known as the "Festin Bill" (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin). Looc was then consolidated into the special municipality of Tablas together with all other municipalities in the island and demoted to a barrio with a representative in the town's capitol in Odiongan. During the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines, the town became one of several emergency municipalities sponsored by the guerilla movement in the province. On 1 October 1946, Commonwealth Act No. 581 was repealed by Republic Act No. 38 (authored by Congressman Modesto Formilleza), thus abolishing the special municipality of Tablas and restoring Looc to its municipal status.</p>
                                                                    <p>On 21 March 1961, the municipality of Alcantara was created from the eastern barangays of Looc, reducing the municipality to its present size. Looc is a nice place to live.</p>

This was followed shortly by Onhan-speaking settlers from Panay. Around 1810, a group of Bantoanon-speaking people settled in the area in search of a place more suitable for agriculture. However, the settlement founded by these Bantoanons were destroyed and pillaged by Muslim pirates. In 1840, another attempt was made by a different group of Bantoanons; this time, they constructed a fort or "cota" which protected the settlement from attacks and natural calamities. In 1855, the settlement was officially designated by the Spanish colonial authorities as a "pueblo" or town. When the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896, the town joined the cause of the revolutionaries led by Tomas Fiedacan.</p>

                                                                    <p>During the American colonial period in the Philippines, Odiongan faced a number of catastrophes: a cholera epidemic in 1902 killed much of the town's population, a strong typhoon lashed the town in 1908, and famine struck the town in 1914. However, the perseverance and determination of the townsfolk led to the town's continuous existence.</p>
                                                                    <p>In 1940, the town became the seat of the special municipality of Tablas, created by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581 (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin), which covered the entire island. It remained so throughout the Japanese occupation of the Philippines from 1941-1945. During that time, Odiongan was chosen as the headquarters of the resistance movement in the province, under the leadership of Lt. Col. Enrique Jurado. On 4 September 1943, a Japanese gunboat shelled the town to force the guerrillas out of hiding. This was followed the following month by a landing of Japanese forces from Panay, which massacred people in the various towns of Tablas, Romblon, and Sibuyan, including Odiongan.</p>
                                                                    <p>On 1 October 1946, the special municipality of Tablas was abolished by Republic Act No. 38. The following year, Odiongan was restored to its original jurisdiction as municipality in the province of Romblon.</p>

                                                                    <p>San Agustin was known during Spanish times as Guintigui-an because of the abundance of a fish called "tigue" in the area. Negrito and Mangyan tribes from Panay and Mindoro were the first inhabitants, as well as migrants from island of Romblon, and southern Tablas.</p>
                                                                    <p>In the early part of Spanish conquest, the first settlement was at barangay Cabolutan. The early settlers found it very trying at times to cross the channel to Romblon town to attend to civil and religious duties. To solve this problem, Cabolutan leaders discussed the matter such as building a visita in their settlement of around 250 souls. Finally in 1635, the first church building made of coral stone and lime was started.</p>
                                                                    <p>In 1700, Spanish authorities decided to separate Cabolutan in Tablas Island from Romblon, with its seat at visita Cabolutan subjugating all settlements west of Tablas Island. The new pueblo or town of Cabolutan progressed slowly and grew more populous despite frequent Moro kidnapping raids. However, in 1790, a smallpox epidemic almost wiped out the town's entire population. The heavy casualty toll caused the pueblo’s abolition which led to re- incorporation to Romblon until 1855, when another pueblo named Guintigui-an was founded some 4 kilometers south of the old town site. The town was founded by Don Laureano Montesa together with his brother Don Esteban and cousin Don Luis Montesa, who became Tiniente Absoluto in Romblon. Its jurisdiction included what is now the towns of Calatrava and Santa Maria. The construction of the Cotta (fort) at Payong-Payong hill (located in present-day barangay Cagbo-aya), started in 1873. Cotta protected the community from Muslim pirates and still stands today. In 1868, the town was renamed "Badajoz" by Andres Lebarde, a visiting Spanish soldier, after his native city of Badajoz, Spain.</p>
                                                                    <p>On 20 June 1957, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1660, Badajoz Town was changed to San Agustin after the town's patron saint.</p>

                                                                    <p>San Andres was originally a barangay of Odiongan which became a municipality on 1920. During the pre-Spanish era, it was a native settlement of nipa huts known as Parpagoja, named after a rare large bird that had its nest among the thicket along the river where settlement was located. Among the first Spaniards to reach Parpagoha during the later half of the 19th century was Don Jose de Tiran, a military commander of Romblon who set out an inspection trip of the surrounding villages. On reaching the place he ordered a civil guard to fetch a glass of water from nearby well. The water turned out to be salty and the Spaniard yelled "salado!", issuing an official order to that effect. Thus, Parpagoha came to be known as Salado.</p>
                                                                    <p>In 1882, a prominent resident of Salado named Rufino Leaño was accused of a crime by an influential Spaniard, Don Barcelo. He succeeded in having Leaño imprisoned without trial in the provincial jail of Capiz, to which Romblon then belonged to as a sub-province. Years later, the Spanish Governor-General Eulogio Despujol (1891-1893) visited Capiz, and Leaño successfully sought an audience with him. Governor Despujol found Leaño innocent and set him free. On reaching his hometown, he successfully petitioned the provincial governor to change the name of Salado to Despujols in honor of the Governor-General.</p>

Garcia's administration, the fourth change of name for the town came through the enactment of Republic Act No. 3358. The town was renamed San Andres in honor of the town's patron, Saint Andrew, patron of fishermen, since most of the people of San Andres are fisherfolk.</p>

She was so loved and revered by the locals that they named her Santa Fe, and in her death, they named the place after her. However, in Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas by Spanish conquistador Miguel de Loarca, it states that the barrio was named after Santa Fe in the province of Granada in Spain. Its first settlers were Onhan-speaking Negritos from Panay Island who emigrated to Tablas as early as 1730.</p>
                                                                    <p>During the Spanish colonial period, Santa Fe was a barrio of neighboring Looc town until 1855 when it was established as a separate pueblo or town. It was abolished and reverted into a barrio again in 1868. In 1892, the Spaniards restored Santa Fe's municipal status, which would remain until the American colonial period.</p>
                                                                    <p>Santa Fe was one 11 municipalities created in Romblon when civilian government was established in the province. However, on 10 March 1917, it was abolished and reverted once more into a barrio of Looc. On 8 January 1940, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581, authored by Romblon congressman Leonardo Festin, the municipality of Looc was abolished and incorporated into a new special municipality called Tablas. Hence, Santa Fe became a barrio of this special municipality.</p>
                                                                    <p>On 1 October 1946, by virtue of Republic Act No. 38 authored by Romblon congressman Modesto Formilleza, the special municipality of Tablas was abolished and Looc municipality was reinstated. The law also created Santa Fe into an independent municipality.</p>
