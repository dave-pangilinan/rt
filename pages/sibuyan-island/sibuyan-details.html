                            <h2>Sibuyan</h2>
                            <p><em>The Galapagos of Asia.</em></p>
                            <p>Sibuyan is a crescent-shaped island, the second largest in an archipelago comprising Romblon Province, Philippines. Located in the namesake Sibuyan Sea, it has an area of 445 square kilometres (172 sq mi). The island has two prominent peaks, Mount Guiting-Guiting with a height of 2,058 metres (6,752 ft) and Mount Nailog with a height of 789 metres (2,589 ft). The people speak the Sibuyanon dialect of Romblomanon, a Visayan language.</p>
                            <p>Sibuyan has been dubbed by some local and international natural scientists as <em>the Gal&aacute;pagos of Asia</em>, because it has remained in isolation from the rest of the world since its formation. Never in its geological history has it ever been connected with any part of the Philippine archipelago. Seismic forces pushed up a 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) peak from the earth&rsquo;s crust, forming a series of smaller peaks and slopes. The peak is Mt. Guiting-Guiting (literally means "the saw-toothed mountain", in reference to its jagged ridge). Because of the steep slopes, much of its original forest remains untouched, and the rest is the island as we find it today.</p>
                            <p>Primary forests cover 140 square kilometres (54 sq mi), which is 33% of the land area of Sibuyan. However, most of the lower altitude forest has been logged or is secondary. Mt. Guiting-guiting Natural Park (equivalent to the IUCN category of National Park) was established to protect these forests, which are mainly in the centre and north of the island, and covers an area of 157 square kilometres (61 sq mi) out of Sibuyan&rsquo;s total area of 445 square kilometres (172 sq mi). The park features a scenic landscape with twin towering peaks set amidst closed canopy forests. Its forests remain largely intact, and include the entire elevational gradient from lowland dipterocarp forest (at 200 to 900 m) and mangroves, through montane forest (above 700 m) to mossy forest, heathland and montane grassland around the peaks.</p>
                            <p>The island is shared by three municipalities; <strong>Cajidiocan</strong>, <strong>Magdiwang</strong>, and <strong>San Fernando</strong>.</p>
                            <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                            <p>Sibuyan has a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna which are threatened by an emerging aggressive promotion of mining industry by the country's government. Exact figures on numbers of total plant species are hard to give, as biologists stumble upon species yet unidentified by the scientific community. In one study, the National Museum identified 1,551 trees in a single hectare, with 123 species of trees, and of this number, 54 are found nowhere else in the world. Hence, it has been proclaimed as one of the world’s most diverse and dense forests. There are estimated to be 700 vascular plant species on the island. Nepenthes sibuyanensis, a pitcher plant species, is also endemic as its scientific name suggests. There are 131 species of birds and ten species of fruit bats, and many dwelling mammals, reptiles, and rodents yet to be fully catalogued. Three birds subspecies are endemic to Sibuyan: the Philippine hanging parrot (Loriculus philippensis bournsi), the Philippine Pygmy-woodpecker (Dendrocopos maculatus menagei), and the Orange-bellied Flowerpecker (Dicaeum trigonostigma sibuyanicum), all of which were recorded there in the early 1990s. Five species of threatened mammals, one fruit bat and four rodents, are endemic to Sibuyan, and the endangered fruit bat Nyctimene rabori occurs there.</p>

Hence, Cajidiocan, as well as the rest of Romblon, became part of the province of Panay. It was administered as a visita (barrio) of pueblo de Romblon, together with Visita de Azagra.</p>
                                                                            <p>In 1744, Pueblo de Sibuyan was founded by the Spaniards with Visita de Cajidiocan as its seat. It was one of the early pueblos established and administered as part of Capiz province, the others being Cabolutan, San Agustin (established in 1700), Looc, established in 1844, Romblon and Banton. Beginning in 1779, the friars ordered the construction of stone fortifications in these four pueblos as a defense against attacks from Muslim pirates. One of these forts was built in Bantay de Lubug, Cajidiocan.</p>
                                                                            <p>On 23 July 1843, the pueblo changed its name to Cajidiocan, derived from the word jidioc, which means "palm", an abundant tree in the area. On 21 November of the same year, the locals were given Spanish surnames starting with the letter "R" as ordered by Spanish governor-general Narciso Claveria.

However, when Romblon was abolished as a province on 15 July 1907 due to insufficient income, jurisdiction of the municipality was returned to Capiz, which would last until 1917, when Romblon was reinstated as a province.</p>
                                                                            <p>On 8 June 1940, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581 authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin, the special municipality of Sibuyan was created, with Cajidiocan as its seat and absorbing the neighboring municipalities of Magdiwang and San Fernando. After World War II, on 1 October 1946, this special municipality was abolished by Republic Act No. 38, sponsored by Congressman Modesto Formelleza, and reinstated Cajidiocan, Magdiwang, and San Fernando to its original municipality status.</p>
                                                                            <p>In 1958, Sibuyan's first government hospital, the Sibuyan District Hospital was established by virtue of Republic Act No. 2400, sponsored by Congressman Jose D. Moreno. On 18 June 1961, through Republic Act No. 3384, Cantagda was created into a separate barrio taken from barrio Danao. Meanwhile, on 17 June 1961 barrio Lumbang was split into two barrios of Lumbang Este and Lumbang Oeste with its old barrio Centro located at Barangay Lumbang Este, while sitios attached to Lumbang Oeste were the following: Pawala, Guinalan, Cansuyat, Agnaga and Hagimit.</p>

                                                                            <p>Based on civil and church records from 1820, Magdiwang was founded as Fundacion de Naylog, a settlement established in the northern coast of Sibuyan Island by religious missionaries led by Don Valentin Ayala. It was placed under the jurisdiction of Pueblo de Sibuyan, whose seat was located in Cajidiocan town. In 1855, the settlement was one of 17 new pueblos (towns) added to the four already existing in the province and was renamed Magallanes, in honor of Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan.</p>
                                                                            <p>Six years later, on 21 February 1861, another pueblo, Rancheria de Infiel, was organized close to Magallanes, located in the upstream of the present poblacion in what is now Barangay Dulangan. This new pueblo was established for the sake of the relocated Mangyanes or May-as tribe, who used to live in the mountains, so that missionary works and Christianizing efforts conducted in the lowland villages will be extended to them as well. This pueblo was incorporated later on, during the American occupation, as part of Magdiwang.</p>
                                                                            <p>Thirteen years later, on 11 January 1868, when Romblon was converted into a province, Magallanes was demoted to a missionary center from its former status as pueblo by the first governor of the Romblon, Don Joaquin Corillo.</p>
                                                                            <strong>Modern History</strong>

Magallanes was one of 11 new municipalities. In 1917, due to reorganization and the province's difficult financial status as a newly restored entity, the former municipality of Magallanes was abolished and annexed to Cajidiocan. It was only restored to its independent municipality status on 1 March 1933, with the new name Magdiwang, in honor of the Magdiwang faction of the Philippine revolutionary group, Katipunan. It was inaugurated through festivities which lasted from 24 to 25 March 1933 and led by Governor Manuel T. Alvero.</p>
                                                                            <p>On 8 June 1940, the special municipality of Sibuyan was established through the passage of Commonwealth Act No. 581, sponsored by Congressman Leonardo Festin. Magdiwang was abolished and was annexed to the new municipality with its seat at Cajidiocan town proper. The special municipality of Sibuyan was abolished through the passage of Republic Act No. 38, which was authored by Congressman Modesto Formelleza and took effect on 1 October 1946, when President Manuel Roxas signed the Republic Act no. 38, restoring Magdiwang as a municipality.</p>

It is one of two visitas in Sibuyan Island, the other being Cajidiocan. In 1744, Cajiodiocan was turned into a pueblo (town) which included Visita de Cauit.</p>
                                                                            <p>The first villages or barrios of Visita de Cauit were Pag-alad, Cangumba, Mabolo or San Roque, Canjalon, España or Canago, Agtiwa, Cangumon and Otod. After Romblon was made a separate district in 1853, and the local government reorganization of 1855, 17 new pueblos were created including Visita de Cauit. On 3 February 1868, Pueblo de Cauit was renamed Pueblo de Azagra. One of Azagra's villages, Visita de Pag-alad was renamed Visita de San Fernando in 1882, in honor of Ferdinand Magellan.</p>

                                                                            <strong>Modern Era</strong>

However, by the end of the year, the seat of the municipality was transferred from Azagra to San Fernando village, thereby, changing the town's name.</p>
                                                                            <p>On 8 June 1940, the passage of Commonwealth Act No. 581, sponsored by Congressman Leonardo Festin, created the special municipality of Sibuyan. It abolished San Fernando and was annexed to the new town whose seat of government was in Cajidiocan. The special municipality of Sibuyan was abolished by Republic Act No. 38, authored by Congressman Modesto Formilleza and enacted on 1 October 1946. It effectively restored San Fernando into its former status as an independent municipality.</p>
                                                                            <p>In 1958, San Fernando High School, the town's highest institution of learning was converted into a national school for arts and trades known as Romblon National Vocation School under Republic Act No. 2428.</p>
